Our main goal for this project is a modern, simplistic site that will simplify our current bloated (~300 page) site.</p>

				<h1 class="timeline-title">Software Intern for Dinner Lab</h1>
				<p class="timeline-content">I landed my first internship with a startup in the summer after my freshman year. When I first started, I thought I knew web development. By the time my internship was up, I learned more than I could have imagined and I knew that I still didn't "know" web development. I was able to spend time with some incredible folks working at the best New Orleans startup. It made me obsessed with the "startup life" and, if possible, made me even more of a foodie. </p>

So, when my freshman english professor suggested I consider applying to the HUB (our campus' writing center), I was ecstatic. This position has allowed me to pursue one of my interests beyond technology, while teaching me valuable communication tactics and leadership skills.</p>
