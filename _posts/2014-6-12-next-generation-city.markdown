excerpt: An Immersive and Informational Map built using Google Maps JavaScript API v3.
---

I created [NextGenerationCity.com](http://nextgenerationcity.com/index.html) as a digital media project for Professor Kirk Glaser's Critical Thinking & Writing 2 class (Writing about Sustainability) during the Winter 2014 quarter at Santa Clara University. I worked with a group of three other people for this project, who aggregated the information displayed, while I led the development of the site.

The website is an interactive map built off of Google Maps Javascript API v3 that allows the viewer to learn about the sustainability of Germany on three different levels: regional, city, and neighborhood.

This project was my first experience with JavaScript, my first time using an API, and my first website. Needless to say, there was quite a learning curve, but I really enjoyed building it!

I used Google Maps markers to give the user different pieces of information about the region when they clicked on the icons.

<a href="{{ "/assets/images/ngc_3.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img class="postImage" src="{{ "/assets/images/ngc_3.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"></a>

I also incorporated [FancyBox](http://fancybox.net) to display a one-time only "pop-up" (see the first picture) using cookies, and a video "pop-up" when the user entered the HafenCity section.

I used [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) for the typography, and styled the map using custom colors and data.
