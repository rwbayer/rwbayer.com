Over Winter break, I decided that I wanted to refresh my most basic programming skills. I've been wanting to read [*The C Programming Language*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) for a long time now, and I decided that this was as good a time as any to be able to check it out and refresh myself on some good ol' C programming.

I'll post a full review here when I'm done, but for now you can follow along [here,](https://github.com/rwbayer/TheCProgrammingLanguage) where I'll be posting the Exercises as I go. 

*Disclaimer: I'm in Winter quarter right now, and I'm currently taking a few advanced programming classes, so my progress on this will probably not be as quick as I'd like it to be.*
