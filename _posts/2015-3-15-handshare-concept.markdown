excerpt: A wearable concept for networking.

HandShare is a wearable concept created for The Intel Edison Product Challenge hosted by [INNOVATE @ SCU.](http://innovate.engr.scu.edu/index.htm)

The wearable replaces the business card by giving a natural, gesture-based alternative to networking. 

When two HandShare users shake hands, their information (profile) is exchanged. The user can decide how much (or little) information is available on their profile, and users can also choose from several other options such as automatically sending LinkedIn connection requests upon shaking hands. 

After a networking event or conference, users can use the HandShare phone application to see who they met, view the resumes and experience of their new friends, or choose to connect on other social networks or in person.

HandShare eliminates the need to take out your phones to exchange numbers, the awkward social networking request phase, the inefficiency of business cards, and the absurdity of bumping phones together by creating a new, natural method of networking.

HandShare.
Making Networking Natural.
